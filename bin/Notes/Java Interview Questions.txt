1)what are the subinterfaces of collection interface or what are the main interfaces in collections in java

a) list, queue, set


collection = combining some elements.To overcome arrays limitations we have collections concept.

4)In collection add method returntype is boolean.some collections doesn't allow duplicates if duplicates present it will throw error instead throwing error they used Boolean to show false.

5)Difference between 1)arraylist & 2)hashSet?

a) ArrayList Doesn't allow duplicates. HashSet allow duplicates.
	

6)what happens if we add dupliactes to HashSet?

a)It will give return type Boolean. If value add returns True otherwise False.



7)what is your location strategy in your project?

a)X - Path


8)why you not encourage absolute x-path?

a)Absolute x paths contains indexes which may change because of some ui changes so which may break our scripts we are executing after any change. it always starts from (/html).


9)what is return type of add() method in collections?

a)Boolean T or F

10)what is return type of put() method in HashMap?

a)Value


1. getLastRowNum()

✔ Starts from index 0 (zero-based).
✔ Counts both empty and non-empty rows (as long as they were used before).
✔ Returns the index of the last used row (not the total count).

❌ Does not count spaces separately → It only looks at the last used row index.


---

2. getLastCellNum()

✔ Starts from index 1 (one-based).
✔ Counts both empty and non-empty cells (if they were used in a row).
✔ Returns the index of the last used column + 1 (not the total count).

❌ It does not count spaces separately, but if a cell contains only spaces, it is still considered a used cell.


---

3. getPhysicalNumberOfRows()

✔ Starts from 1 (one-based count).
✔ Counts only rows that have at least one non-empty cell.
✔ Returns the total number of rows that contain data.


---

4. getPhysicalNumberOfCells()

✔ Starts from 1 (one-based count).
✔ Counts only non-empty cells in a row (ignores empty cells).
✔ Returns the total number of non-empty cells in a row.
